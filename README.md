## What is a Keto Diet?
A ketogenic diet is a low-carb, high-fat eating plan that forces the body to enter a metabolic state called ketosis. When in ketosis, the body burns fat for energy instead of carbohydrates, leading to weight loss and other health benefits.

## Benefits of a Keto Diet
- **Weight Loss**: The keto diet helps reduce hunger and increases fat burning.
- **Improved Mental Clarity**: Ketones serve as an efficient fuel source for the brain.
- **Stable Blood Sugar Levels**: Beneficial for people with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.
- **Increased Energy Levels**: Fats provide a stable source of energy.
- **Reduced Inflammation**: Helps with chronic diseases and improves overall health.
